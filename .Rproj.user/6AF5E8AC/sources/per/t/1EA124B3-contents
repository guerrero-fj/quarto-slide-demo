## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

```{r}
library(plotly) 

fig <- plot_ly()%>%
  add_trace(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(1, 3, 1), type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers')
config(fig, scrollZoom = TRUE)%>%layout(plot_bgcolor='#e5ecf6',
          xaxis = list(
            zerolinecolor = '#ffff',
            zerolinewidth = 2,
            gridcolor = 'ffff'),
          yaxis = list(
            zerolinecolor = '#ffff',
            zerolinewidth = 2,
            gridcolor = 'ffff')
          )
```
